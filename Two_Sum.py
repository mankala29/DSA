#Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
#You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.

#Example 1:
#Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
#Output: [0,1]
#Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
